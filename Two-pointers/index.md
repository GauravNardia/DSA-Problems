# This list covers must-practice problems using the **Two Pointer** pattern, ordered from easy to hard.

# Two Pointer Approach

> Two pointers is a technique where you use two indices (pointers) to iterate  
> through data (usually arrays or strings) in a strategic way â€” either

## When to Use It?

- You want to compare elements from both ends of an array or string (e.g., palindrome check).
- You want to remove or shift elements while traversing in-place (e.g., remove duplicates or move zeroes).
- You want to find pairs or count combinations that meet some condition (e.g., two sum in sorted array).
- You want to traverse at different speeds (like detecting cycles in a linked list with slow and fast pointers).
